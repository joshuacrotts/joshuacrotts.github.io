    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">By the end of this lab, students should be able to use iteration to determine the
        distance between a point and several objects in a plane, change angle-of-view and position via keyboard input,
        and modify graphics/shapes in a plane. Students should also understand how two-dimensional top-down rendering
        translates to a first-person, pseudo three-dimensional perspective.</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Raycasting is an old rendering technique used in video games and computer graphics that allows two-dimensional rendering of primitive shapes to be projected/portrayed in a pseudo-three dimensional environment. Because of the complexity of rendering three-dimensional graphics, game developers decided to only render in two-dimensions while giving the effect of the third dimension! In this lab, you will create a small program that allows a user to traverse a two-dimensional world in the third dimension.</p>
    <h2>What To Do</h2>
    <ol style="text-align: justify;">
        <li>First, download the accompanying Raycaster.zip file. Inside, you will find three Java classes: RaycasterRunner, RaycasterPanel, and SwingApplication. The latter SwingApplication initializes boilerplate code for the front-end Swing components, so unless you are interested, it is not necessary to investigate this code further. There are a few methods that we use, but the underlying implementation is beyond the scope of this lab. This lab was designed with the Eclipse IDE, but it can work with or without an IDE.</li>
        <li>After setting up the project, get accustomed to the two other classes. The main class, RaycasterRunner, as the name suggests, runs the application and initializes all GUI components. On the other hand, RaycasterPanel is where you will be doing most of the laborious work. This JComponent object is called a JPanel. In short, rendering and drawing should occur on this panel object. To test your environment, we have included a couple lines of code that draws a blue rectangle on the screen inside the paintComponent method using the Graphics2D class. Play around with this to see if you can try different colors or even different shapes. Remove these lines (except the first two) once you are done experimenting.</li>
        <li>Since we’re going to be creating an environment for rays to collide with, we obviously need objects for the ray to collide with, right? So, let’s do that. Create a class called RectangleObject. The idea is this: we’re going to populate our world with random rectangles that serve as walls. A RectangleObject should have, at minimum, an x/y coordinate pair and dimension fields.</li>
        <li>Now, you may be wondering: “Where do we instantiate these objects?” Well, we can populate them in the RaycasterPanel class. Create a list of RectangleObjects with random dimensions and positions. The size of the list doesn’t necessarily matter, but try to keep it lower than twenty (20) objects. Also, make sure that objects do not generate outside the world!</li>
        <li>At this point, you should have a fully populated list of RectangleObjects. It is now time to draw them! Note that JComponents have the paintComponent(Graphics g) method for drawing. We’re going to do something similar. Since we’re going to be drawing objects besides RectangleObjects, we should create an interface that says something is “drawable”. Create an interface called Drawable with the method signature void drawObject(Graphics2D g2d). From here, implement the interface in RectangleObject and override its method in your subclasses. Now, add the functionality to draw the shapes. Finally, in your panel class, iterate over your list of objects and call drawObject on each one. When drawing the rectangles, draw them at their center! Drawing them at the top-left causes severe problems down the road. So, make sure you apply the correct math offsets to draw the shape at its center (note that I said draw at the center; not position at the center. If you position at the center then you’ve already done this part!).</li>
        <li>We’re now ready to start our ray caster! The first thing we need is some type of “camera” or perspective to start at. The camera will be the location of the “player”, so to speak. Create a class called Camera and another called Ray. Camera should have a position and an ArrayList of Ray objects. The camera will project out several hundred individual rays that form a cone that acts as the field of view (i.e., what the camera can see).</li>
