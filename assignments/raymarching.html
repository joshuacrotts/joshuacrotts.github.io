  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">By the end of this lab, students should be able to use iteration to determine the
    distance between a point and
    several objects in a plane, change angle-of-view and position via mouse input, and modify graphics/shapes in a
    plane. Students should also be able to understand the benefits of raymarching over other two-dimensional collision
    detection techniques.</p>
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Today's world of computing is filled to the brim with colorful and life-like graphics
    - continuing to blur the line
    from fantasy and reality. Has it ever occurred to you to think about how games, animators, and others create these
    amazing works of art? In this lab, we're going to explore the topic of sphere-tracing: a type of ray marching
    algorithm. </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">First, let's back up and understand what ray tracing is, since ray marching is a
    derivation. Ray tracing involves a
    camera and an environment (also called a world). The camera projects simulated lines called rays into the world
    which then interact with objects in the world. Think of it like a light source; light travels from its source to
    objects which is then reflected and altered based on the colliding object. Try to imagine how a computer would need
    to do this. A computer has to, mathematically, determine when a collision with an object occurs so as to not
    erroneously pass through that object (we're ignoring translucency!). A naive solution is to extend, or march, the
    ray outward in intervals of a predetermined unit, checking for collision along its path. This raises an obvious
    question: what is a unit, and what about the interval? Look at the diagram below.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Note that the star is the camera (i.e., where our ray begins), and the purple line is
    a wall, or an object. If we
    assume our ray checks for collisions every 2 squares, then the ray passes right through the object! The solution
    would be to change our frequency to checking for collisions every one square. Though, imagine this world is
    significantly bigger. If we check for collisions too often, it's slow. Conversely, too few implies the possibility
    of missing an object. Sphere tracing provides a happy medium.</p>
  <h2>What To Do</h2>
  <ol style="text-align: justify;">
    <li>First, download the accompanying <samp>RaymarchingLab.zip</samp> file (listed above). Inside, you will find
      three
      Java classes:
      <samp>RaymarcherRunner</samp>, <samp>RaymarcherPanel</samp>, and <samp>SwingApplication</samp>. The latter
      <samp>SwingApplication</samp> initializes boilerplate code
      for the front-end Swing components, so unless you are interested, it is not necessary to investigate this code
      further. There are a few methods that we use, but the underlying implementation is beyond the scope of this lab.
      This lab was designed with the Eclipse IDE, but it can work with or without an IDE.
    </li>
    <li>After setting up the project, get accustomed to the two other classes. The main class,
      <samp>RaymarcherRunner</samp>, as the
      name suggests, runs the application and initializes all GUI components. On the other hand,
      <samp>RaymarcherPanel</samp> is
      where you will be doing most of the laborious work. This <samp>JComponent</samp> object is called a
      <samp>JPanel</samp>. In short, rendering
      and drawing should occur on this panel object. To test your environment, we have included a couple lines of code
      that draws a blue rectangle on the screen inside the <samp>paintComponent</samp> method using the
      <samp>Graphics2D</samp> class. Play around
      with this to see if you can try different colors or even different shapes. Remove these lines (except the first
      two) once you are done experimenting.
    </li>
    <li>Since we’re going to be creating an environment for rays to collide with, we obviously need objects for the ray
      to collide with, right? So, let’s do that. Create two subclasses called <samp>RectangleObject</samp> and
      <samp>CircleObject</samp> that
      extend an abstract superclass <samp>CollisionObject</samp>. The idea is this: we’re going to populate our world
      with random
      rectangles and circles. A <samp>CollisionObject</samp> should have, at minimum, an <span class="math inline">\((x,
        y)\)</span> coordinate pair. <samp>RectangleObject</samp> should
      have width/height fields, and <samp>CircleObject</samp> should have a radius/diameter field, whichever you prefer
      (note which
      one you use to construct the object because it will be relevant later).
    </li>
    <p><img src="../img/caution.png" /> <b>Warning!</b> Make absolutely sure that you use double or float variables when
      initializing positions. When drawing with Swing, you can do one of a few things: either create objects with the
      <samp>java.awt.geom</samp> package that allow for explicit doubles when instantiating shape objects (e.g.,
      <samp>Line2D</samp>, <samp>Rectangle2D</samp>,
      <samp>Ellipse2D</samp>) and then draw those with <samp>g2d.drawShape()</samp>, or cast doubles to integers and use
      other methods in
      <samp>Graphics2D</samp>. Later on when we perform arithmetic on the positions and dimensions, floating-point
      operations are
      crucial to ensure we don’t encounter integer truncation issues.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../img/caution.png" /> <b>Warning!</b> If you’re trying to set the positioning based on the
      screen/window size, you’ll need to use <samp>this.getPreferredSize().width</samp> and
      <samp>this.getPreferredSize().height</samp>. This is
      because the <samp>JPanel</samp> hasn’t been packed into the parent <samp>JFrame</samp> component when the
      <samp>CollisionObject</samp> are instantiated.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../img/caution.png" /> <b>Warning!</b> Keep note of whether the objects are instantiated at the center
      or the top-left. Whether you do either or is up to you, but if you instantiate them at the center now, it’s
      slightly less effort later. Otherwise, you have to do a bit more later on since we’ll be working with the center
      of objects.
    </p>
    <p class="question"><img src="../img/question.png" class="question" /> Try this out: if you are familiar with
      vectors, writing
      your own small 2-D vector class to handle positioning,
      dimensions, and movement is extremely beneficial!</p>

    <li>Now, you may be wondering: “Where do we instantiate these objects?” Well, we can populate them in the
      <samp>RaymarcherPanel</samp> class. Create a list of <samp>CollisionObjects</samp> with random dimensions and
      positions. The size of the
      list doesn’t necessarily matter, but try to keep it lower than twenty (20) objects. Also, make sure that objects
      do not generate outside the world!
    </li>
    <li>At this point, you should have a fully populated list of <samp>CollisionObjects</samp>. It is now time to draw
      them! Note
      that <samp>JComponent</samp>s have the <samp>paintComponent(Graphics g)</samp> method for drawing. We’re going to
      do something similar.
      Since we’re going to be drawing objects besides <samp>CollisionObjects</samp>, we should create an interface that
      says
      something is “drawable”. Create an interface called <samp>Drawable</samp> with the method signature void
      <samp>drawObject(Graphics2D
        g2d)</samp>. From here, implement the interface in <samp>CollisionObject</samp> and override its method in your
      subclasses. Now, add
      the functionality to draw the shapes. Finally, in your panel class, iterate over your list of objects and call
      <samp>drawObject</samp> on each one. When drawing the objects, draw them at their center! Drawing them at the
      top-left causes
      severe problems down the road. So, make sure you apply the correct math offsets to draw the shape at its center
      (note that I said <u>draw</u> at the center; not <u>position</u> at the center. If you position at the center then
      you’ve
      already done this part!).
    </li>
    <p class="question"><img src="../img/question.png" class="question" /> Try this out: give each shape a random
      <samp>Color</samp>
      attribute! The <samp>Graphics2D</samp> method
      <samp>setColor(java.awt.Color)</samp> may be useful!
    </p>
    <img src="../img/raymarching1.png" style="float: center;" />
    <li>We’re now ready to start our ray marcher! The first thing we need is some type of “camera” or perspective to
      start at. It also would be a little boring if we could only march rays in one direction, right? So, we’ll need to
      add a listener to our camera, but we’ll get to that as we go. Firstly, Create a class called <samp>Camera</samp>
      and another
      called <samp>March</samp>. <samp>Camera</samp> will be where the ray begins marching, and <samp>March</samp> will
      be a single step, or iteration, in the
      ray march. Both of these will have <span class="math inline">\((x, y)\)</span> coordinates and radii. This is
      almost identical to the <samp>CircleObject</samp> class,
      and we could reuse it, but because they serve different purposes (and we’re going to add more to it), we’ll just
      rewrite a new class. We’ll first write the <samp>Camera</samp> class since it is more interesting.</li>
    <li><samp>Camera</samp>, as we mentioned earlier, is the starting point of our ray march. So, like
      <samp>CollisionObject</samp>, we’re going
      to implement <samp>Drawable</samp>. The camera is just a small circle, so giving it a fixed radius of, say, ten
      (10) pixels is
      sufficient. Do the same thing you did for <samp>CircleObject</samp>: draw the camera at the provided x and y
      coordinates.
    </li>
    <li>Now, we’re ready to move our camera! There are two ways we can do this: with keyboard input or mouse input. We
      will choose the latter. As we move the mouse around the world, we want our camera to follow us. Thankfully, Java
      provides a very nice <samp>MouseMotionListener</samp> interface for us to implement. Once <samp>Camera</samp>
      implements this, you will be
      required to override two methods, but we only need to write code inside one: <samp>mouseMoved(MouseEvent)</samp>.
      Whenever we
      move the mouse, we want to update the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
        class="math inline">\(y\)</span> coordinates of <samp>Camera</samp>. Any time the mouse is moved, the mouseMoved
      method is called, and the <samp>MouseEvent</samp> parameter contains two methods: <samp>getX()</samp> and
      <samp>getY()</samp>. So, assign the coordinate
      instance variables of <samp>Camera</samp> to these values in this method.
    </li>
    <li>The only thing that’s left is to register the motion listener with the panel. So, create an instance of
      <samp>Camera</samp>
      inside the <samp>RaymarcherPanel</samp> constructor. Call <samp>addMouseMotionListener</samp> and pass it the
      <samp>Camera</samp> object. Also, don’t
      forget to call <samp>drawObject</samp> from <samp>Camera</samp> inside <samp>RaymarcherPanel</samp>’s
      <samp>paintComponent</samp> method or you won’t see anything!
      Run the program and you should see your camera move as you move the mouse.
    </li>
    <p><img src="../img/caution.png" /> <b>Warning!</b> If you place the camera’s draw method above the loop where you
      draw the objects, you won’t see it if your mouse is over an object. Can you deduce why?
    </p>
    <p class="question"><img src="../img/question.png" class="question" /> Try this out: If you assign the <span
        class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
      <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> coordinates to the exact position of the mouse event’s <span
        class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> coordinates,
      it will
      be slightly offset. Try and find out why and how to fix it (note that it has nothing to do with the assignment
      itself!).
    </p>
    <img src="../img/raymarching2.png" style="float: center;" />
    <li>
      <p>Now, let’s begin the raymarching! As we mentioned, we’re going to implement sphere tracing, where we compute
        the minimum distance between the mouse and all objects in the scene. So, we first need to understand how to
        compute this. We’re essentially computing the hypotenuse of the triangle formed from the center of the camera to
        an object’s center. So, let’s look at this for both cases.</p>
      <p>For circles, We need to account for only one thing: the radius. Take the distance (also called the magnitude if
        you’re familiar with vectors) from the camera to the center of the circle and subtract its radius. The formula
        is as follows: </p>
      <p><span class="math display">
          \[
          d = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2} - r
          \]
      </p>
      <p>Where <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y_1\)</span> represent the
        coordinates of the camera’s center, and <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>, <span
          class="math inline">\(y_2\)</span> represent the center of the circle. <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>
        is the radius of the circle. In the figure below, we want to compute the magnitude (length) of the green line).
        This is <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> in the above equation.</p>
      <img src="../img/raymarching3.png" style="float: center;" />
      <p>Rectangles are a bit more complicated since we’re involving both width and height instead of just a radius. The
        simplest way to do it is to compute the distance between the camera and the line segments that make up the
        rectangle. <samp>Line2D</samp> provides a great method for computing this distance: <samp>ptSegDist</samp>.
        There are four line segments
        that make up each rectangle, so just take the minimum of all four segments. Note that creating the line segments
        is ever so slightly harder (not by much at all!) if you chose to center the rectangle instead of using its
        top-left coordinate. In the figure below, note that each line segment is denoted by <span
          class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span>, <span
          class="math inline">\(L_3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(L_4\)</span>.
        Recreate this in your program using the aforesaid methods. A good idea would be to create an abstract method
        <samp>computeDistance(double cameraX, double cameraY)</samp> in <samp>CollisionObject</samp> which is overridden
        and implemented in your
        subclasses. <i>Tips: This step will most likely take the most amount of time so use the Swing classes to your
          advantage! <samp>Point2D</samp>, <samp>Line2D</samp>, etc. are all helpful!</i>
      </p>
      <img src="../img/raymarching4.png" style="float: center;" />
    <li>Now, iterate through your list of objects and compute the minimum distance between the camera’s position and
      each object. Use this distance to draw a circle at the camera’s center with a radius of the minimum distance
      multiplied by two <i>(think about why we do this!)</i>. As you move the mouse around the screen, you should notice
      that
      the circle is drawn out to touch the nearest object.</li>
    <p><img src="../img/caution.png" /> <b>Warning!</b> If you only multiply the distance of the circle by two and don’t
      adjust where the circle is drawn, your circle will be drawn at an incorrect spot! So, be sure to multiply the
      distance by two, then draw it at the camera’s center.
    </p>
    <img src="../img/raymarching5.png" style="float: center;" />
    <img src="../img/raymarching6.png" style="float: right;" />
    <li>We’re almost there! What we need to do now is actually cast multiple marches out into the world instead of just
      one. The idea is as follows: march out as far as you can until you collide with something. Compute the minimum
      distance from that point to every other object in the world and march out to that point. We need to eventually
      stop marching if the march has a small enough radius (say, 0.01). If the minimum distance from the current point
      to any other object is smaller than this threshold, we can deduce that we have collided with something and cast
      the ray. Let’s start with the <samp>March</samp> class.</li>
    <li>A march consists of four primary things: a circle, line, a starting point, and an ending point. The line’s
      length should be equal to the radius of the circle. Create the <samp>March</samp> class with these properties.
      Then, implement
      the drawing functionality.</li>
    <li>A ray consists of multiple marches. So, we can create a <samp>Ray</samp> class that receives a list of
      <samp>March</samp> objects. When
      drawing the ray, draw all the marches that are in its list.
    </li>
    <li>Lastly, we need to add this new functionality to the panel. You should use a loop to keep track of the minimum
      distance between the current iteration point and any object in the world, and once this goes below that threshold
      mentioned in step 12, break out, then initialize and draw a <samp>Ray</samp>. When marching, the next point should
      be created
      at the current point plus the length of the march (with no alterations to the y coordinate - see step 16 for more
      on this!).</li>
    <p><img src="../img/caution.png" /> <b>Warning!</b> If your program is freezing, check to make sure that your
      distance functions are correctly computing the minimum distance, and that your threshold isn’t too low (below 0.01
      can cause floating-point precision errors). Also, when setting up the loop to continue until the minimum distance
      is below the threshold, you most likely want a do-while loop because you want at least one iteration to complete
      prior to breaking out. Further, you may want to keep track of the ending position of the current point in the
      march - if it goes beyond the screen, you should terminate the loop! Finally, if you’re noticing that, as you move
      the mouse closer to a point that it suddenly locks up, check to make sure all coordinates are floating point and
      non-integer!
    </p>
    <p><img src="../img/caution.png" /> <b>Warning!</b> The same bug with the circle’s rendering location occurs here if
      you don’t offset it like step 11 informed you.
    </p>
    <img src="../img/raymarching7.png" style="float: center;" />
    <li>This is nice, but wouldn’t it be neater if we could rotate that ray? It sure would be!. First, let’s consider
      what is going on when marching. As we said in step 15, we’re only advancing along the x-axis and not the y-axis.
      This makes drawing our marches (and hence the ray) easy since there’s no trigonometry involved. But, to advance
      along both axes, we need a new field in the <samp>Camera</samp> class to keep track of the angle. After this, we
      need a way of
      modifying said angle. There are a few ways to do this, but we’ll go with a mouse approach again. Let’s suppose
      that when the user clicks the left mouse button, their camera angle will increase, and decrease if they click the
      right mouse button. To implement this, we need to use the <samp>MouseListener</samp> interface, and again, it will
      require that
      you import a whole bunch of methods but we only need to use one: <samp>mousePressed(MouseEvent)</samp>.</li>
    <li>In mousePressed, a <samp>MouseEvent</samp> is supplied, just like <samp>mouseMoved</samp>. The difference is
      that we will be using the
      getButton method to determine which button was pressed instead of checking for position. To check which button was
      pressed, use <samp>event.getButton() == MouseEvent.BUTTONX</samp>, where <samp>X</samp> represents the button (1
      is
      the left mouse button, 3
      is the right button). Write the code to increment the angle by 1 if the left mouse button was pressed, and
      decrement by 1 if the right button was pressed. After this, add the <samp>Camera</samp> instance as a
      <samp>mouseListener</samp> object to
      the panel.
    </li>

      <p>So, this doesn’t change much if you run it. However, now we can update our ray drawing procedure. To do this,
        we can use polar coordinates.</p>
      <p>We have our starting coordinate pair <span class="math inline">\(P_1\)</span>, and the minimum distance from
        <span class="math inline">\(P_1\)</span>
        to
        any object in the plane is <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. The
        camera’s angle is <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> in radians. We wish to compute <span
          class="math inline">\(P_2\)</span>, the ending coordinate pair to this line. Thus,
      </p>
      <span class="math display">
        \begin{align*}
        P_{2_x} &= P_{1_x} + l \cdot \cos(t)\\
        P_{2_y} &= P_{1_y} + l \cdot \sin(t)
        \end{align*}
      </span>
      <p>Use this logic to update your code and see what it does now.</p>

    <p class="question"><img src="../img/question.png" class="question" /> Try this out: You may notice that constantly
      clicking the
      mouse to change the angle is a bit cumbersome. Use some of the other <samp>MouseListener</samp> methods to change
      this
      functionality!
    <p>
      <li>And that’s it! You’ve successfully created a sphere tracing ray marcher. Continue to add new things such
        as different shapes! You can add triangles and polygons in the same way that we did the rectangles.</li>
