    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>
      For each problem, create a class named <code>ProblemX</code>,
      where <code>X</code> is the problem number
      (e.g., <code>Problem1.java</code>).
      Write corresponding JUnit test classes named
      <code>ProblemXTest</code>. 
      Each method must include proper Javadoc comments describing the (1) purpose of the method, (2) parameters, and (3) return value.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>
        Do not round your solutions. For example, do not use
        <code>Math.round</code> or float your output to, e.g.,
        2 decimal places, unless specified.

    <h2>What You <em>Cannot</em> Use</h2>

    <p>
      You may not use anything beyond Chapter 1.1.
      This includes but is not limited to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Strings</li>
      <li>Conditionals</li>
      <li>Loops or recursion</li>
      <li>Arrays or data structures</li>
      <li>Regular expressions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You <strong>may</strong> use methods from the <code>Math</code> class, as well as comparison (e.g., <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>==</code>) and logical operators (e.g., <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Any violation results in a score of <strong>0</strong> on the problem set.

    <h2>Notes and Version Changes:</h2>
    <p>
    <b>Note 1:</b> This page (and other assignments and materials) use MathML for formatting mathematics. This uses special fonts for mathematics, which usually works but seems to be missing on some computers. The best "check" for this is to look at question 6 below - the "v" should have a subscript "i". If you see that, great! If you don’t see it (e.g., just see a box) then you should investigate how to install MathML fonts (or use a different browser...).
    </p>   
    <p>
      Update 01/14: clarification to Problems 4 and 9 with the permitted use of logical OR.
    </p>
    <p>
      Update 01/19: clarification to Problems 4 and 9; you <i>are allowed</i> to use logical OR, but it is not required.

          The z-score is a measure of how far a given data point is away from the mean of a normally-distributed sample.
          In essence, roughly 68% of data falls between z-scores of [−1, 1], roughly 95% falls between [−2, 2], and
          99.7% falls between [−3, 3]. This means that extreme outliers have z-scores of either less than −3 or greater
          than 3.

          Design the <code>boolean isExtremeOutlier(double x, double avg, double stddev)</code> method that, when given
          a data point $x$, a mean $\mu$, and a standard deviation $\sigma$, computes the corresponding z-score of $x$
          and returns whether it is an "extreme" outlier. Use the following formula:

          The "square root curve" is a method of scaling grades for an assessment.
          The idea is to "curve" a student's grade to a "more meaningful" grade.
          For example, suppose a student scores 65/100 on an exam.
          Their curved score is \(\sqrt{65}\cdot 10 \approx 8.06 \cdot 10 \approx 80.62\).
          Therefore, the student earned 15.06 points from the square root scale.
          Design the <code>double squareRootScalePoints(double score, double maxPoints)</code> method that, when given a raw score and the maximum number of points for some assessment, returns the number of points earned <i>from the curve</i>.
          For example, <code>squareRootScalePoints(65, 100)</code> returns approximately 15.62, because the student earned an 80.62 after the square root scaling.
          If the exam were out of 80 points, i.e., <code>squareRootScalePoints(65, 80)</code>, the method would instead return a value that is approximately 7.111.
          (Note: this exercise purposefully omits the mathematical details to get you to think about what you're supposed to do!)
